# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for ChainTrace, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration with Hedera Hashgraph services. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack while prioritizing hackathon demonstration requirements and post-MVP expansion capability.

This unified approach combines traditional backend and frontend architecture concerns with Hedera's managed services (Custom Compliance Engine, HCS, HTS, Mirror Node) to streamline development for modern DLT-enabled supply chain verification.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

However, based on the technical assumptions, the project indicates preferences for:

- React.js with Next.js for rapid development and SSR capabilities
- Tailwind CSS for design system implementation
- Vercel for deployment platform

This suggests we should consider **Vercel's Next.js templates** or **T3 Stack** as potential starter templates that align with the specified technology preferences and hackathon timeline constraints.
