# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Demonstrate DLT feasibility for supply chain verification using Hedera stack within hackathon timeline
- Show scalability potential with technical architecture ready for real-world deployment
- Validate user experience through clean, accessible interfaces requiring no specialized blockchain knowledge
- Establish expansion foundation with working MVP that demonstrates clear post-hackathon development pathway
- Prove Custom Compliance Engine can handle supply chain verification scenarios
- Showcase HCS message logging for immutable product journey documentation
- Demonstrate HTS token rewards for verification actions to incentivize participation

## Background Context

ChainTrace addresses critical supply chain transparency challenges in African markets, where over $1.5B in annual losses from fraud and inefficient compliance processes burden small-scale producers. The solution leverages Hedera Hashgraph's enterprise-grade DLT capabilities through Custom Compliance Engine, HCS message logging, and HTS token rewards to provide tamper-proof verification and automated compliance documentation.

The hackathon MVP focuses on demonstrating core technical capabilities rather than full production deployment, targeting Nigerian agricultural cooperatives, food manufacturers, and regulatory systems. The approach balances authentic problem understanding with hackathon constraints, building on Hedera's managed services to minimize custom development while showcasing expansion potential for addressing broader African supply chain opacity issues.
