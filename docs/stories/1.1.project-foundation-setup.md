# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** complete project initialization with build system, deployment pipeline, and development environment,  
**so that** the team can develop efficiently with consistent tooling and automated deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint/Prettier configuration
2. **Vercel deployment pipeline configured with automatic builds and preview deployments:**
   - Vercel project linked to GitHub repository with automatic deployments
   - Production deployment configured for main branch with custom domain
   - Preview deployments configured for all pull requests
   - Build optimization settings configured for optimal performance
   - Deployment health checks implemented to validate successful deployments
3. **Environment variable management setup for development, testnet, and production configurations:**
   - Development environment variables defined in `.env.local`
   - Testnet environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
   - Production environment variables secured with appropriate access controls
   - Environment variable validation implemented to catch missing configurations
   - Specific variables defined: `NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_NETWORK`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIRROR_NODE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID`, `GUARDIAN_API_URL`
4. **Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore and branch protection rules:**
   - Repository branch protection rules requiring PR reviews and status checks
   - Automated CI checks configured to run tests and linting before merge
   - .gitignore configured to exclude sensitive files and build artifacts
   - Git hooks configured for pre-commit linting and formatting
5. Development scripts configured (dev, build, test, lint) with consistent code formatting
6. Basic project structure established with clear separation of concerns (components, pages, services, utils)

### Project Structure Architecture

**Source: [source-tree.md]**
The complete directory structure must follow the defined architecture:

```

```

### Critical Configuration Requirements

**Source: [coding-standards.md]**

- **JSDoc Documentation**: All public functions must have complete JSDoc comments
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration with no implicit any
- **Import Paths**: Use path mapping (@/components, @/lib) for clean imports
- **Error Handling**: Implement standard error handler patterns from start
- **Environment Access**: Use config objects, never process.env directly

### Required Environment Variables

**Source: [epic-1-details]**
Essential variables that must be configured:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_NETWORK`: Hedera network configuration (testnet/mainnet)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIRROR_NODE_URL`: Mirror Node API endpoint
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Database connection URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous access key
- `HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID`: Hedera operator account ID
- `GUARDIAN_API_URL`: Custom Compliance Engine endpoint

### Testing Strategy

**Source: [architecture documents]**

- **Unit Testing**: Vitest 1.0+ with TypeScript support for fast testing
- **Component Testing**: Testing Library 14.x for React component tests
- **Integration Testing**: API route testing with Supertest
- **Configuration**: Test environment variables and build processes
- **Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds for critical configuration code

### Development Workflow

All development must follow these standards:

1. TypeScript strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking
2. ESLint + Prettier run on every commit via pre-commit hooks
3. Automated testing on pull requests before merge
4. Environment variable validation on application startup
5. Clear separation of concerns with domain-organized components

### Performance Considerations

- Next.js built-in optimizations for production builds
- Vercel edge deployment for optimal global performance
- Static asset optimization through Next.js image optimization
- Bundle analysis and size monitoring from project start

- Security headers configured (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental secret commits
- Server-side only validation prevents client exposure

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance foundation:

- Next.js 14 optimizations enabled (compression, image optimization)
- Standalone output for optimal deployment
- Build analysis and bundle monitoring ready
- Edge deployment configuration for Vercel

### Files Modified During Review
