# Summary

The ChainTrace fullstack architecture successfully balances:

- **Security**: Wallet-first authentication with no private key storage
- **Performance**: Sub-30 second verification through caching and Edge Functions
- **Scalability**: Component-based design with clear separation of concerns
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and comprehensive error handling
- **User Experience**: Real-time updates, progressive enhancement, and intuitive interfaces

This unified architecture document provides the complete technical foundation for AI-driven development of the ChainTrace supply chain verification platform, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack while meeting all PRD requirements for hackathon demonstration and future expansion.
