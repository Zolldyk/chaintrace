# Epic 2 Details - Supply Chain Workflow & Custom Compliance Engine

**Epic Goal:** Implement complete supply chain participant workflows with Custom Compliance Engine enforcement, enabling cooperative managers to log products and automatically generate verification credentials through business rule compliance, while providing QR code generation for seamless consumer verification.

## Story 2.1: Custom Compliance Rule Configuration

As a **system administrator**,  
I want **Custom Compliance Engine configured with Producer → Processor → Verifier workflow rules**,  
so that **supply chain participants can receive automated verification credentials when they comply with defined business processes**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Custom compliance rule engine implemented with clear supply chain role definitions
2. Producer role configured via `/api/compliance/validate-action` to log initial product creation with required metadata fields
3. Processor role established for handling product processing/transformation events through compliance API
4. Verifier role implemented for final verification and credential issuance via compliance engine
5. Business rule logic enforces proper sequence of Producer → Processor → Verifier actions
6. Automated credential generation triggered upon successful compliance validation
7. Compliance engine tested with all workflow scenarios and role interactions
8. Comprehensive documentation created explaining business rules and participant requirements

## Story 2.2: Cooperative Manager Product Logging Interface

As a **cooperative manager**,  
I want **to log product batches with all required information through an intuitive web interface**,  
so that **I can efficiently document my members' products and initiate the verification process**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Product logging form with all required fields (product type, quantity, origin, processing details)
2. Batch operation support allowing multiple products to be logged simultaneously
3. Form validation ensuring all Custom Compliance Engine requirements are met before submission
4. Integration with `/api/compliance/validate-action` to automatically trigger Producer role actions
5. Real-time feedback showing compliance validation status and any business rule violations
6. Batch processing completed in under 2 minutes per batch as specified in requirements
7. Success confirmation with generated product IDs and initial verification status
8. Local backup of product data until successful blockchain confirmation (FR16 requirement)

## Story 2.3: HCS Event Logging System

As a **system**,  
I want **to log all product journey events to HCS with immutable timestamps and actor identification**,  
so that **complete audit trails are maintained for regulatory compliance and consumer verification**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. HCS message format implemented with product ID, timestamp, location, and actor fields
2. Product creation events automatically logged when Custom Compliance Engine Producer actions complete
3. Processing events captured during Processor role workflow execution via compliance APIs
4. Verification events recorded when Verifier role issues final credentials through compliance validation
5. Message serialization and deserialization handling for all event types
6. Error handling with retry mechanisms for failed HCS logging attempts (FR15 requirement)
7. All events retrievable via Mirror Node API within 30 seconds of logging
8. Message integrity validation ensuring tamper-proof audit trail maintenance

## Story 2.4: QR Code Generation and Product ID System

As a **cooperative manager**,  
I want **unique QR codes generated for each logged product that link to verification information**,  
so that **consumers can easily verify products without requiring manual ID entry**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Unique product identification codes generated using secure random algorithm
2. QR codes automatically created linking to product verification pages
3. QR code images downloadable in multiple formats (PNG, SVG) for printing flexibility
4. Product IDs also support manual entry in verification interface (FR6 requirement)
5. QR code scanning redirects to web interface without requiring app downloads
6. Bulk QR generation available for batch operations supporting cooperative workflows
7. QR codes contain minimal data (product ID only) to maintain scanning reliability
8. Generated codes stored locally with blockchain confirmation for offline access

## Story 2.5: Custom Compliance Credential Management

As a **supply chain participant**,  
I want **to receive and display compliance verification credentials when business rule validation is achieved**,  
so that **my verification status is officially documented and visible to consumers and regulators**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Custom compliance credential issuance triggered automatically upon business rule validation completion
2. Credential status tracking integrated with product verification display via `/api/compliance/carbon-credit` and `/api/compliance/supply-chain` endpoints
3. Credential metadata includes issuer, timestamp, and compliance validation details
4. Credentials retrievable and displayable in human-readable format through compliance API
5. Integration between compliance credentials and HCS event logging for comprehensive audit trail
6. Credential expiration handling with clear visual indicators (FR13 requirement)
7. Error handling for credential issuance failures with clear user messaging
8. Third-party credential verification functionality through compliance validation endpoints
