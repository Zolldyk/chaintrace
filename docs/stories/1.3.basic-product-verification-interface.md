## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.2 Dev Agent Record]

- MirrorNodeService.ts is already implemented with 30-second timeout and retry logic - leverage for product lookups
- Error handling utilities in src/lib/errors.ts provide comprehensive error classes and retry patterns
- Structured logging system is implemented across core services - use for API endpoint logging
- Hedera service health monitoring is established - integrate verification API health checks
- React error boundaries and error handling hooks are available in src/hooks/useErrorHandling.ts

### Tech Stack Requirements for Frontend Components

[Source: tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.x with App Router for file-based routing

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.0+ with strict configuration for component props and API responses
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.0+ with React Testing Library 14.x for component testing

### Component Architecture and File Locations

[Source: frontend-architecture.md, unified-project-structure.md]

- **Verification Components**: Create in `src/components/verification/` directory
  - ProductLookup.tsx - Input field and search functionality component
  - VerificationStatus.tsx - Status display with visual indicators
  - ProductTimeline.tsx - Product information and journey display
- **API Routes**: Create verification endpoint at `src/app/api/products/[productId]/verify/route.ts`
- **Services**: Product verification service at `src/services/verification/ProductVerificationService.ts`
- **Routing Structure**: Consumer pages in `app/(consumer)/` with verification pages at `app/(consumer)/verify/[productId]/page.tsx`

### Data Models for Product Verification

[Source: data-models.md]

- **Product Interface**: Use existing Product interface with VerificationStatus enum ('verified', 'unverified', 'pending', 'rejected', 'expired')
- **ProductEvent Interface**: Display product journey events with Actor, Location, and EventType data
- **Location Interface**: Display origin information with coordinates and address details
- **Error Handling**: Use existing ApiErrorCode enum patterns for consistent client-side error handling

### Mirror Node Integration Requirements

[Source: Story 1.2 implementation]

- **Service Integration**: Use existing MirrorNodeService.ts with established rate limiting and caching
- **API Endpoint**: Leverage existing Mirror Node client configuration with 30-second timeout
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement cache-first pattern with fallback to stale data during service failures
- **Health Checks**: Integrate with existing HealthCheckService.ts for service monitoring during verification

### UI/UX Design Patterns

[Source: components.md, frontend-architecture.md]

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoint system
- **Visual Indicators**: Use semantic colors (green for verified, yellow for pending, red for rejected/error)
- **Loading States**: Implement skeleton components and progress indicators for 30-second API timeout
- **Error Boundaries**: Use existing ErrorBoundary.tsx and ErrorState.tsx components for graceful error handling
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG AA+ compliance using Headless UI accessible component patterns

### API Endpoint Implementation Details

[Source: backend-architecture.md, external-apis.md]

- **Route Structure**: Next.js API route at `/api/products/[productId]/verify` using Edge Runtime for performance
- **Mirror Node Integration**: Use existing @hashgraph/mirror-node-client with optimized query patterns

- **Error Codes**: Implement standard ApiErrorCode responses (PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND, MIRROR_NODE_TIMEOUT, INVALID_PRODUCT_ID)
- **Rate Limiting**: Leverage existing rate limiting configuration (100 req/sec from Mirror Node)

### Performance and Caching Requirements

[Source: core-workflows.md, external-apis.md]

- **Response Time**: Sub-30 second verification requirement through cache-first strategy
- **Cache Strategy**: Use existing Supabase caching layer with 300-second TTL for Mirror Node responses
- **Edge Functions**: Deploy product verification API as Vercel Edge Function for minimal cold starts
- **Bundle Optimization**: Lazy load verification components to reduce initial page load
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Show cached data immediately with background refresh for latest information

### Security and Validation Requirements

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent compliance with JSDoc documentation and TypeScript strict typing
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence to specified directory structure and file naming conventions
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **Major Gap** - No verification-specific tests found despite comprehensive test requirements in Task 5
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ **Partial** - ProductTimeline component verification needed, testing requirements unfulfilled

### Improvements Checklist

**Testing Implementation (Critical Priority):**

- [ ] Create unit tests for ProductLookup component with input validation and error state testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for VerificationStatus component with all status variants and accessibility testing

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✅

Excellent security implementation:

- Comprehensive input validation with regex patterns preventing injection attacks
- Proper error sanitization preventing information leakage
- CORS configuration with appropriate headers
- Rate limiting integration through Mirror Node service
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposure

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✅

Well-architected performance features:

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review - the existing implementation quality is excellent.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-basic-product-verification-interface.yml

**Gate Reasoning**: While the implementation is of exceptionally high quality and meets most acceptance criteria, the complete absence of testing infrastructure represents a significant gap that must be addressed before production deployment. The available Playwright MCP configuration provides an excellent foundation for E2E testing that should be leveraged.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

**Priority**: Address comprehensive test suite implementation as specified in Task 5, with particular emphasis on:

1. Unit tests for all verification components
2. E2E tests using Playwright MCP for browser automation
3. Integration tests for API endpoints
4. Verification of ProductTimeline component existence and functionality
