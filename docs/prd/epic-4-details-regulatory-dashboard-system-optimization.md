# Epic 4 Details - Regulatory Dashboard & System Optimization

**Epic Goal:** Deliver a compelling regulatory observer dashboard that demonstrates supply chain oversight capabilities and ensures system performance meets hackathon demonstration requirements.

## Story 4.1: Regulatory Observer Dashboard (CRITICAL - HACKATHON WOW FACTOR)

As a **regulatory officer**,  
I want **a single dashboard page showing total compliance overview with flagged non-compliant products**,  
so that **I can instantly assess market compliance status and identify enforcement priorities**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Dashboard displaying total verified vs. unverified product counts** with clear visual representation (charts/counters)
2. **Real-time compliance status showing percentage of verified products** in the system with prominent display
3. **Red flag list showing products missing required verification credentials** with product IDs and missing credential types
4. Clean, professional interface demonstrating regulatory oversight capability for hackathon judges
5. Simulated data acceptable for demonstration purposes if live data insufficient

## Story 4.2: System Performance Validation

As a **system user**,  
I want **reliable system performance during demonstrations**,  
so that **all verification functionality works consistently during hackathon presentations**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Verification page loads product data from Mirror Node in under 10 seconds** for demonstration reliability
2. All core user journeys (product lookup, QR scanning, cooperative logging) function without errors during demo
3. System handles multiple concurrent users accessing verification features simultaneously
4. Error handling prevents system crashes during demonstration with graceful degradation
