# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Create wireframes and visual designs for ChainTrace's supply chain verification platform. Focus on three core interfaces: consumer product verification (QR scan + manual entry), cooperative manager product logging dashboard, and regulatory observer compliance overview. Prioritize mobile-responsive design with clear visual status indicators, following the established design system (WCAG AA+, clean typography, strategic color use for verification states). Ensure seamless user flows across verification journeys while maintaining accessibility and performance optimization for Nigerian market conditions.

## Architect Prompt

Design technical architecture for ChainTrace MVP using Hedera services (Custom Compliance Engine, HCS logging, HTS tokens, Mirror Node API). Implement hybrid client-side heavy architecture with React/Next.js frontend, Foundry Cast encrypted key management, and Vercel deployment. Focus on Custom Compliance Engine configuration for Producer→Processor→Verifier workflow, HCS message logging for immutable audit trails, and Mirror Node integration for sub-30 second verification lookups. Ensure testnet reliability for hackathon demonstration while designing for post-MVP expansion to USSD, mobile money, and regulatory integrations.
